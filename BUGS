Emulation-related bugs
======================

This is a non-exhaustive list of games that are currently not working properly
in DGen due to bad or incomplete emulation.

Working, with glitches
----------------------

- Double Dragon 2
Sometimes slower than it should be.

- Sonic 2 prototype
No sound/music (works fine with Cyclone).

- Street Racer
Mangled pictures in the intro.

- Streets of Rage 1
End of level counter sound is bad.

- Aleste - Full metal fighter Ellinor
Some HUD areas are wrong.

- Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco
Sky is black and top screen color is wrong.

- Golden Axe 2
Some sort of loop at start that freezes DGen for a while.

- Gynoug
Menu/intro backgrounds are mangled (works fine with Cyclone).

- Super Hang-on
Bad horizon line.

- Thunder force 3
Main weapon sound is bad.

- Thunder force 4
Corrupt intro.
Some versions don't work at all.

- Viewpoint
Menu background is mangled.

Non-working (must be fixed)
---------------------------

- All hacked games with added intros
They either display a blank screen or crash after the intro.

- Time killers
Blank screen.

Non-working (this is expected)
------------------------------

- Ya-Se Chuan Shuo
Freezes (missing hardware?)

- Virtua Racing
Missing proper hardware emulation.
